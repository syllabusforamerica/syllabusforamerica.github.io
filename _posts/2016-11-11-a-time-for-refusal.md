abstract: "Links between an allegorical/absurdist play written by Eug√®ne Ionesco in 1958, in response to totalitarian movements in Europe, and normalization of a Trump presidency that is going on in the days after the election."
quote: "Evil settles into everyday life when people are unable or unwilling to recognize it. It makes its home among us when we are keen to minimize it or describe it as something else. This is not a process that began a week or month or year ago. It did not begin with drone assassinations, or with the war on Iraq. Evil has always been here. But now it has taken on a totalitarian tone."
