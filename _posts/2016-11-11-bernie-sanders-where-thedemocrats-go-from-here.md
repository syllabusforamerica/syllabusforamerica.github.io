title: "Bernie Sanders: Where the Democrats Go From Here"
source: "New York Times"
tags: ["Bernie Sanders","populism","mandate","Trump"]
author: "Bernie Sanders"
date: "2016-11-11"
abstract: "Bernie situates himself (and progressives generally) in relation to a Trump presidency, arguing that Trump's election is a mandate to protect the interests of the working class. Insofar as Trump implements policies in support of this mandate, Bernie promises to support him. Insofar as he uses his power to harm the underclass, Bernie will fight him."
quote: "President-elect Trump is right: The American people want change. But what kind of change will he be offering them? Will he have the courage to stand up to the most powerful people in this country who are responsible for the economic pain that so many working families feel, or will he turn the anger of the majority against minorities, immigrants, the poor and the helpless?"
comment: "I appreciate your forced optimism Bernie, but we can be sure he won't actually do any of that. He has already proposed the CEO of Stanley Morgan as Secretary of Treasury. It remains business as usual.‚Äù [link to appointments page re: the CEO of Stanley Morgan] -Chase"
